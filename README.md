# Shop-site
  Technical Requirements:
Implementation details are left entirely up to you, but at a minimum your app must meet the following requirements:

Use Fetch to asynchronously load data from one or more APIs
Use jQuery's DOM traversal and manipulation functionality to display the data from the API to the user in an interesting way
Use jQuery's event listening capabilities to respond to user actions

  Assignment:
Once you've completed your app, push your work up to GitHub, and publish to GitHub pages. In the next checkpoint you'll gather feedback from users, and you should have them use the live version of your app.

Submit a link to your repo and live site below.
